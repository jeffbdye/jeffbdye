### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a software engineer at [@blackbaud](https://www.blackbaud.com/) helping nonprofits bring good to the world
- Most of the projects here on github are just for fun. Their respective READMEs will show where they're running live or tell how to set them up locally
  - PRs or feature requests are always welcome!
